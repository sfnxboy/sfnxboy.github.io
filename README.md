**Tools Used**

JavaScript, HTML, CSS


## Objective

Data professionals not only need to analyze data and draw meaningful conclusions from it, but they also need to visualize the data in order to communicate their findings to an audience. With the power of JavaScript, any programmer can transform their data into significant, eye catching, and interactive data visualizations. PLotly.js is a JavaScript data visualization library used to create an interactive data visualization for the web. It’s a data scientists task to identify the best way to share her information with her audience, and engage them using dynamic charts.


## Plotly.js

Built on top of D3.js and stack.gl, plotly.js is a high-level, declarative charting library. Plotly.js allows programmers to craft over 40 types of charts, including bubble charts, 3-D charts, and even SVG maps. This library is fully customizable because plotly.js charts are described declaratively as JSON objects. Every aspect of the charts, from colors, to grid lines, and the legend, has a corresponding  set of JSON attributes.

W3.CSS is a modern CSS framework for desktop, tablet, and mobile design support. It was designed to be smaller and faster than similar CSS frameworks, and some may find it to be easier to learn and easier to use. To use W3.CSS on a website, simple include the link in your .html file. 
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css">
```

Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. Bootstrap also easily and efficiently scales your websites and applications with a single code base, from phones to tablets to desktops with CSS media queries. Bootstrap supplies an extensive number of customizable HTML elements, has a lot of supportive documentation, as well as HTML plugins. To add Bootstrap on your website, simple add the link below to your HTML file.
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css">

CSS frameworks relieve your cross-browser concerns, and as mentioned above they scale websites to all sorts of devices. They supply clean and symmetrical layouts, especially if the CSS framework you choose uses a grid-based system to set up a multi-column arrangement, which is what is utilized in this project. Bootstrap is supplies pre-defined pixel-widths so a programmer can focus on content creating rather than lining up blocks of text. A good CSS framework is analogous to using automatic transmission, it helps the driver make use of the car in a simpler fashion and more efficiently.

JavaScript’s D3 library allowed me to create interactive visualizations that brings any static website to life. The charts created using plotly.js are visually appealing and grab the readers attention easily. They can be understood at first glance, and are simple to interpret. The different charts the plotly.js and D3 provide, such as the bubble chart below, describes a third dimension of data. The bubble chart is the perfect plot to use in this circumstance because they’re great at visualizing data that contains three value sets, rather than a scatter plot which describes two categorical data sets. Different bubble sizes are useful to visually emphasize specific values. It goes without saying that JavaScript allows for a fully customizable experience.
